# Brewing Science

Dig into the science and mathematics behind brewing with BrewSci!

This repository aims to cross check commonly used equations used in brewing by
providing the original data and reference materials in a way that can be
explored and checked independently.  May equations referenced in the home
brewing community are taken for granted as being correct.  Here the aim is
to verify the great work of those that came before in an open and clear
fashion.

# Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebooks using python will be the primary way in which data is
explored.  The advantage here is that notebooks provide a clear and interactive
way to play with the data.
