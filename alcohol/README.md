C.J.J. Berry developed the simplest method:
Alcohol by Volume = (Original Gravity _ Terminal Gravity) / 7.36

A sample calculation for beer will look like the following, based on the assumptions that 1.05= the amount of CO2 produced for every gram of ethanol produced and .79 is the density of ethanol alcohol:

ABV = ((1.05 * (Original Gravity â€“ Terminal Gravity)) / Terminal Gravity) / 0.79 * 100
